Apple Shortcuts that turn your Reminders and Notes App into a Quest Manager &amp; Log with sound effects!

1. REQUIREMENTS

You need at least an iOS device and an iCloud account to run these Shortcuts.

2. STEP-BY-STEP

2.1. PRE-INSTALLER SHORTCUT

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU DOWNLOAD AND RUN THE THE PRE-INSTALLER FIRST.

Start by downloading The "Pre-installer" Shortcut. It creates all the Dependecies required to run the other shortcuts.

Run the Shortcut. Allow it to access your Documents folder.

You only need to run it once. Delete the Pre-Installer afterwards.

Note: As of today, the Pre-Installer Shortcut only works if run from an iOS device (not MacOS, not iPad OS).


2.2. You can now download and install the other shortcuts (Add new Quest, Update My Quests, My Personal Logs).

NOTE: Once installed, the Shortcuts will function in iOS, MacOS and iPad OS. However, you need to install them from your iOS device.
